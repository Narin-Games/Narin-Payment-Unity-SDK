# Narin-Payment-Unity-SDK
This SDK is implemented for the integration payment method of online app stores (Googleplay, Cafebazaar, Myket) as a single interface.

If you want to release your game in multiple app stores, this SDK will have the following advantages for you:

- No need to create different branches in git to get the build of each store
- Implement payment of all stores with just one implementation
- Can be used in implementation of **Distributed Build System** and **Batch Building**
